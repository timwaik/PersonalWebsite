        <p class="left">My name is Tim, and I'm a bunny loving, 23 year old graduate from The University of Manchester. This is a website describing my academic acheivements as well as other extracurricular activities that I have undertaken in my life.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="rightcontent">
        <p class="right">I have always been fascinated by technology and programming (My course degree might have given you a hint). This is one of the main reason's why I built this personal website, learning how to write in HTML5 and CSS along the way.</p>

        <p class="right">I was born in New Zealand, and moved to Malaysia a few months after I was born. I lived in KL where I went to a public primary school, followed by a private secondary school.</p>

        <p class="right">So, whether you've found my website through my LinkedIn account, or on my CV, or even if you just happened to stumble across it on the internet, welcome, and I hope you're having a great day!</p>
