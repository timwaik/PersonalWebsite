      <div class="leftcontent">
        <h3 class="left">I'm left handed.</h3>
        <p class="left">Did you know that only about 10% of the human population are left handed?</p>
        <h3 class="left">I enjoy running. A lot.</h3>
        <p class="left">Running always helps me clear my mind, and keeps me focused. The fresh air and exercise doesn't hurt as well.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="rightcontent" id="aboutpageright">
        <h3 class="right">I absolutely love bunnies.</h3>
        <p class="right">They are without a doubt the cutest little critters on the planet. I used to have a pet rabbit, whose name is <span id="redacted">a secret ;)</span>. She used to bite EVERYTHING in my house (yes, walls included)</p>
        <h3 class="right">Although I was born in New Zealand, I'm a Malaysian, through and through.</h3>
        <p class="right">Often I've wondered what my life would have been like if I had stayed, and grown up as a Kiwi instead.</p>
      </div>
      <h2 class="smallTitle2">And finally, a couple of extras;</h2>
      <div class="bottomcontent">
        <p>1. My favourite season is winter.</p>
        <p>2. I once tripped down a flight of stairs, somersaulted in mid-air, and landed at the bottom on my feet (miracles do exist!)</p>
